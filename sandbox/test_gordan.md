# this is a test

As a follow-up to setting up Github repositories for large design files, I wanted to outline the steps to collaboration using Github. Here are the guidelines I try to follow with the Designers that I collaborate with.
Version control
Design File Management
I store all design file templates, imagery, color palette files, animation files, presentations, user journey files etc.
Collaboration with Designers and Developers
Setting up your repository locally:
Clone the repository
Switch to a new branch
